                    <p class="p">Born and raised in Queens NY, I picked a spot on the globe and moved to Seattle in
                        the Summer of 2016 without a job or idea of how Seattle was going to be. I just knew I
                        needed a change from the grind of NYC. </p>
                    <p class="p">I graduated with a Computer Science degree and although I’ve always had a strong
                        artistic pull, I ended up in IT Support (specifically for Macs). Moving out here and finding
                        a job was tough, especially in Microsoft town for a non enterprise Mac guy, but somehow I
                        landed a job that had opportunity to grow. As I developed into a IT Client Engineer I took
                        on challenges with Powershell and automated AD and 365 tasks for my team, as well as special
                        projects. 
                        
                        I was soon pulled into an Agency wide rollout of ServiceNow and become a backup admin for the project. I worked with javascript within its framework and that sparked my programming history. That is when
                        I decided to pursue development of some kind and am now taking the UW Full Stack Bootcamp
                        course. Here I am, looking for new opportunities to grow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p">Outside of IT, I’ve always enjoyed motorcycling, snowboarding. Those
                        two hobbies took up most of my free time in my mid 20's to late 30’s. These days I prefer traveling and
                        exploring the world.</p>
