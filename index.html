                <p class="p">Born and raised in Queens NY, I picked a spot on the globe and moved to Seattle in
                    the Summer of 2016 without a job or idea of how Seattle was going to be. I just knew I
                    needed a change from the grind of NYC. </p>
                <p class="p">I graduated with a Computer Science degree and although I’ve always had a strong
                    artistic pull, I ended up in IT Support (specifically for Macs). Moving out here and finding
                    a job was tough, especially in Microsoft town for a non enterprise Mac guy, but somehow I
                    landed a job that had opportunity to grow. As I developed into a IT Client Engineer I took
                    on challenges with Powershell and automated AD and 365 tasks for my team, as well as special
                    projects.

                    I was soon pulled into an Agency wide rollout of ServiceNow and became an official backup admin for the
                    project. I worked with javascript for the first time within its framework and that led me to want to grow my skills. That
                    is when
                    I decided to pursue development of some kind and signed up for the UW Full Stack Bootcamp
                    course. Here I am, looking for new opportunities to grow.
                </p>
                <p class="p">Outside of IT, I’ve always enjoyed motorcycling, snowboarding. Those
                    two hobbies took up most of my free time in my mid 20's to late 30’s. These days I prefer traveling
                    and
                    exploring the world.</p>
