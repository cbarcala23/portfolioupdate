                <p class="p">I am from Queens New York and have been living in Seattle since mid 2015. After 35 years I got tired of the constant grind of NYC and decided I needed a change and challenge. I picked a spot on one the globe and chose Seattle. I moved out here without a job or an idea of how Seattle was going to be. </p>
                <p class="p">I graduated with a Computer Science degree and although I’ve always had a strong
                    artistic pull, I ended up in IT Support, specifically for Macs. Moving out here and finding
                    a job was tough, especially in Microsoft town for a non enterprise Mac guy, but I managed to land a job that had opportunity to grow. As I developed into a IT Client Engineer I took
                    on challenges with Powershell and automated AD and 365 tasks for my team, as well as special
                    projects. I also ended up taking ownership of the then current Ticketing system from Microsoft System Center Service Manager. I worked with the vendor to migrate to the latest version on new servers and then became the admin for it. My duties involved creating and modifying templates as needed as well as dealing with HTML notifications.
                    <br><br>
                    With the implementation of ServiceNow as the new ticketing tool to the Agency, I was asked to become an official admin for
                    the
                    project due to my experience with the old ticketing system. I worked with javascript for the first time within its framework and that led me to want to
                    grow my skills. That
                    is when
                    I decided to pursue development of some kind and signed up for the UW Full Stack Bootcamp
                    course. Here I am, looking for new opportunities to grow.
                </p>
                <p class="p">Outside of IT, I’ve always enjoyed motorcycling, snowboarding. Those
                    two hobbies took up most of my free time in my mid 20's to late 30’s. These days I prefer traveling
                    and
                    exploring the world.</p>
